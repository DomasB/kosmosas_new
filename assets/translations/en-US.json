  "text_andrioniskis": "In February 1929, around midnight, the sky of Lithuania lit up with an impressive sight. According to the accounts of the eyewitnesses, a red-bluish ball of light the size of the full moon with a long, tapering tail, approached the earth. A few seconds later, the luminary dimmed and burst into sparks. The spectacle was accompanied by a rumble of thunder that could be heard over a large area of Lithuania. Kaunas University geophysicist Kazys Sleževičius addressed the public, asking those who witnessed the fall of the meteorite to describe it. Over 110 letters were received. After analyzing the astronomer Bernardas Kodatis determined the approximate location where the meteorite fell: the fields of the village of Padvarninkai in the Anykščiai district, near the town of Andrioniškis. Indeed, after the haymaking started, the farmers began to find pieces of the meteorite. The scientific expedition collected 11 meteorite pieces from the local people with a total weight of almost 4 kilograms.\n\nThe Andrioniškis meteorite is a very rare variety of achondrite of the eucrite class; therefore, it has been studied in various laboratories worldwide. It is approximately 4.5 billion years old. In 1969, another piece of this meteorite weighing a kilogram was found, which was donated to the Meteorite Commission by a resident of Andrioniškis. Now four parts of it are kept at Vilnius University and two other pieces are in the mineralogy of the Institute of Geology and Geography, whereas the other fragments are displayed in various museums abroad.",
  "text_birutesKalnas": "Back in the past, Palanga was the hub of southern Curonian handicrafts and trade. Looks like from the very start its destiny was to be at the crossroads between the Teutonic Order and the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, which sought to unite their forces here and create a bridgehead for the attack on Samogitia. At the southern foot of Mount Birutė, on a narrow terrace between the slope and the seashore, a fortified settlement existed from the 10th century, the remains of which in 1983-1984 were explored by a group of archaeologists led by Vladas Žulkus. It turned out that in the second half of the 14th century, an alkas, a sacrificial altar, was built on the mountain, and at the same time it was a site for calendrical measurements, a unique monument of ancient astronomy and the Baltic spiritual culture. At the beginning of the 15th century, when a dispute arose regarding the ownership of the lands, the alkas was destroyed.\n\nThe calendrical measurement device consisted of a system of eleven columns placed on a horseshoe-shaped embankment. The structure's regular geometry suggests that the location of each column was not random but chosen purposefully. The horseshoe of the embankment opens to the southwest, therefore it is suitable for observing the string of celestial bodies. Indeed: the lines drawn through the pairs of columns indicate the positions where the Sun and the Moon set into the sea on the eve of important calendar holidays.\n\nCalendar measurements for determining these dates could be done as follows: an observer stands next to a column and watches the disk of the descending heavenly body through the top of another column. In the summer, the locations of the setting Sun were determined from a post placed on the embankment at a distance; in winter - from the pillar in the middle of the field. The southern group of three columns marks the period of preparation for winter stagnation. The northern group of five columns deals with sowing, crop care, and harvesting.\n\nArchaeologists have found the ashes of numerous bonfires among the pillar sites - these are the traces of festive calendar rites. Calendar customs undoubtedly contain remnants of old nature worship rituals and fragments of the Baltic mythological images.",
  "text_ciurlionioObservatorija": "In October 1919 Vilnius University was newly opened and renamed the Polish University of Stephen Báthory. Astronomer and teacher Wladislaw Dziewulski, who came from Warsaw, was entrusted with establishing a new university observatory, since the old one, founded in the 18th century, was no longer suitable for scientific research. For this purpose, the territory at that time known as Užvingis was chosen - this is where Čiurlionis street currently is. In 1920 an official plan for the complex was provided. Although Dziewulski envisioned the observatory complex emerging quickly, the construction of all three buildings (the Great Tower, the Pavilion, and the Astronomer's House) took approximately 15 years. Despite the delay in construction, the observatory's staff actively carried out scientific activities: they studied the physics of stars, and the galaxy structure, performed spectroscopic research and published the periodic paper of the Vilnius University Observatory. In the late 1940s, plans were made to relocate the observatory, as the approaching city lights and vibrations interfered with the accuracy of the observations. A location in Aukštieji Paneriai was considered, however, the relocation was stopped by the outbreak of World War II. Astronomers who were working at the observatory were repatriated to the city of Toruń. Among them was perhaps the most famous Polish female astronomer, Wilhelmina Iwanowska.\n\n After the Second World War, astrophysics research at the observatory resumed. After a new observatory was opened in Molėtai in 1969, the Čiurlionis street observatory functioned as a place for students to practice.\n\nCurrently, the complex is restored and converted into an \"Observatory of Ideas\" - a science communication venue for little groups of people that gives an opportunity for everyone to have a closer look at the discoveries and exchange of ideas in various scientific fields.",
  "text_jupiter": "Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the entire solar system. Its mass is 318 times that of Earth, and if we added the masses of all the planets in the Solar system, Jupiter`s mass would still be 2.6 times greater. In 2022, it was announced that Jupiter has 80 satellites, the 4 largest ones - Ganymede, Callista, Io, and Europe - are visible even through ordinary binoculars. In fact, Galileo Galilei first observed the moons of Jupiter in 1610 through a homemade telescope, therefore they are called Galileo's satellites.\n\nJupiter also has a ring system; however, they are not visible with an amateur telescope. This planet rotates very quickly on its axis, this is why the length of its day is 10 hours, and the duration of a year is 12 Earth years. Jupiter is surrounded by a dense atmosphere of molecular hydrogen (87%) and helium (13%). Spots are often observed on Jupiter, however, most of them disappear quickly, with the exception of the Great Red Spot, which has been observed for more than 400 years. The sulfur and phosphorus compounds give Jupiter's clouds their brown, yellow, and red hues. The planet`s winds are powerful and can reach speeds of up to 180 m/s.\n\nThe first spacecraft to visit Jupiter (in 1973) was Pioneer 10, followed by Pioneer 11 a year later. Various spacecraft were sent to explore the planet as well: \"Voyager\", \"Ulysses\", \"Galileo\", \"Cassini - Huygens\" and \"Juno\". \"Juno\" is a NASA space probe whose primary goal is to study Jupiter's composition, gravitational field, and magnetosphere. It was launched on August 5th, 2011 and reached its destination in 2016. The end of the mission is expected in the fall of 2025.\n\nIt is assumed that the ancient Lithuanians called Jupiter Indraja (Indra), the daughter of the Sun. Indraja is described as a caring protector of people, bringing them various blessings from the Sun. Indraja was particularly awaited by the sick whom she cured.",
  "text_mars": "Mars, the fourth (rocky) planet from the Sun is smaller than Earth and has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. The planet's mass is ~0.1 of Earth`s mass, its day lasts 24 hours 30 minutes and the duration of a year is 1.9 Earth years. There are many craters, plains, and volcanoes on the surface of Mars. The highest mountains on the planet are 4 volcanoes (Olympus, Arsia, Pavonis, Elysium), whose height varies from ~11 to ~25 km. The atmosphere of Mars consists of carbon dioxide (~95%) and other gases. The pressure at the surface of the planet is 170 times lower than at the surface of the Earth. Due to the rare atmosphere of Mars, the temperature of the surface varies greatly during the day, in the equatorial regions the surface warms up to 20 °C at noon and cools down to -100 °C at night. Strong winds of up to 160 km/h blow every year into the atmosphere, causing regional or planet-wide sandstorms.\n\nLaunched in 1964, \"Mariner 4\" was NASA's first successful reconnaissance spacecraft to send close-up images of the planet. By 2022, about 50 probes have been launched to Mars, unfortunately, only half of the missions were successful. Viking 1 and Viking 2 were the first stationary devices to reach the surface of Mars in 1976. Three rovers are currently travelling and exploring Mars.\n\nIt is believed that the Lithuanians used to call Mars by the name of Žiezdrė. The planet's craters of Gusevas (named after a 19th-century Vilnius astronomer) and Alytus (a town in Lithuania), as well as the Hyperborean (the name of the Baltic tribes in ancient Greece) area at the north pole of Mars, are the Red planet’s geographical features related to Lithuania.",
  "text_neptune": "The eighth planet of the solar system (gaseous), was discovered in 1846, although the existence of Neptune had already been calculated by observing the disturbances in the movement of the planet Uranus. The diameter of the planet is almost 50000 km. As of 2022, 14 satellites of Neptune are known, all of which were named after water deities of ancient Greek mythology. The largest of them is Triton, the only known satellite in our solar system that orbits a planet in the opposite direction to the planet's own rotation. Neptune has a ring system that consists of five rings. They are made of small pebbles and cosmic dust (many micron-sized particles), in their structure they are somewhat similar to Jupiter's rings and are quite difficult to notice because they are black in colour. Neptune's mass is 17 Earth masses. The length of a day is 16 hours whereas the length of a year is 165 Earth years. A spacecraft's journey to Neptune would take about 14 years.\n\nNeptune's atmosphere consists of hydrogen, helium, methane, and ammonia. The surface is constantly covered by clouds, and the wind speed in the atmosphere reaches up to 700 m/s. Its atmospheric temperature is estimated to be -220 °C, no wonder the planet is also sometimes called an ice giant. Neptune is the most distant planet in the Solar system.\n\nThe only spacecraft to reach Neptune was Voyager 2. It flew past the planet in August 1989 and captured images of several of its moons. Voyager 2 passed within 3000 km of Neptune's north pole and circled it once. During the flight, the spacecraft studied Neptune's atmosphere, its rings, and magnetosphere and got relatively close to Triton. Voyager 2 also looked at Neptune's Great Dark Spot, a huge hurricane that, according to Hubble Space Telescope observations, has already disappeared.",
  "text_saturn": "The second largest and sixth planet (gaseous) from the Sun which can be seen without optical devices and thus known since ancient times.\n\n The planet is named after the Roman god of agriculture and time. As of 2022, there are 83 satellites. The first of its satellites was discovered in 1655 and named Titan which has a dense atmosphere that is made up of methane gas. Scientists single out this moon as one of the most realistic candidates in the solar system where life could possibly exist! Titan is thought to contain water ice and possibly liquid water beneath its deep layers. In addition, this satellite is the only body in the Solar System (other than Earth) that has a liquid-liquid exchange system between the surface and the atmosphere. Saturn has a ring system, so the planet got the nickname \"The Lord of the Rings\" for a reason. The rings, which are mostly made of dust, rocks, and ice, stretch ~120000 km from the surface of the planet, and some are only 20 meters thick. The average Saturn distance from the Sun is 1.4 billion km, the length of a day is 10.5 hours, and the length of a year is 30 Earth years. The atmosphere, like that of Jupiter, consists mainly of hydrogen and helium.\n\nSaturn and its surroundings were studied by such spacecraft as \"Pioneer 11\", \"Voyager 1\", \"Voyager 2\", and \"Cassini-Huygens\".\n\n\"Cassini-Huygens\" is a joint mission of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the European Space Agency, and the Italian Space Agency, which lasted almost 20 years. In total, scientific teams from 17 countries of the world contributed to the success of the mission. \"Cassini-Huygens\" went into space in 1997 and reached Saturn's orbit after a journey of nearly seven years. \"Huygens\" separated from \"Cassini\" and landed on Titan in 2005. It sent data to Earth for 219 minutes, until its batteries died.\n\nThe ancient Lithuanians called Saturn Sėlija, after one of the daughters of the Sun.",
  "text_venus": "Venus is the second (rocky) planet in the Solar system that can be observed in the night sky and without optical instruments. Venus is slightly smaller than Earth, its diameter is ~12000 km. The planet spins on its axis in the opposite direction to all the planets - clockwise, this is thought to be because at some point, many years ago, Venus collided with a celestial body. The length of a year is 225 Earth days.\n\nThe atmosphere of Venus is the densest of the Earth-like planets, consisting mainly of carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is 90 times that of Earth’s! Due to the unusually high amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the planet has a strong \"greenhouse effect\", which causes the surface temperature to rise to 464 °C.\n\nThe first unmanned mission to Venus, and indeed the first mission to another planet, was \"Venus 1\", launched in 1961. This mission was unsuccessful. \"Venus 7\" was the first spacecraft to land on the surface of Venus, however, it failed to send images, this was later done by the instruments \"Venera 9\" and \"Venera 10\". Other exploratory missions were also carried out: \"Vega\", \"Pioneer Venus\", \"Magellan\" and \"Akatsuki\".\n\nIn September 2020, scientists reported that they detected phosphine gas traces in the planet's upper atmosphere. Following this discovery, NASA announced that scientists' attention should be focused on the search for life on Venus. In 2021, NASA confirmed two planned missions to this planet - the VERITAS satellite and the \"DAVINCI+\" atmospheric probe. These devices are scheduled to be launched in 2029.\n\nVenus is the celestial body with the most Lithuanian names. The International Union of Astronomers named 40 places on the surface of Venus after Lithuanian goddesses, mythological creatures, and women. The ancient Lithuanians called Venus the \"Aušrinė\" (Morning Star) as well as the \"Vakarinė\" Western Star.",
  "text_nanoAvionics": "Kongsberg NanoAvionics is the first Lithuanian space technology company and one of the world-leading companies in developing small satellites. The company was founded shortly after the launch of the first Lithuanian satellites into space in 2014, initiated by the company's current CEO and founder Vytenis Buzas and his team. The first ever Lithuanian satellite \"LituanicaSat-1\" had a rather unconventional mission - it broadcasted the greetings of the former President of Lithuania Dalia Grybauskaitė from space to Lithuanians all over the world.\n\nToday, the company is growing significantly and supplying satellites and their mission integration services to NASA, ESA, Thales Alenia Space, MIT and other organizations in more than 47 countries. Satellites manufactured in Lithuania are used for various types of missions, such as real-time Earth observation, testing solar sails for intergalactic missions, or monitoring wild animals and their migration in remote regions of the world. The data obtained from satellites help to improve our daily life on Earth - satellites are used for navigation, emergency assistance, and water and natural disaster monitoring.",
  "text_observatorijaKaune": "On March 1, 1923 at the suggestion of the dean of the Kaunas University Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, assistant professor of astronomy Bernardas Kodatis (1879-1957) was appointed to head the Astronomy Cabinet. The reason for this was the desire to create a base for astronomical observations at the university. The following year, a 12 cm-diameter Karl Zeiss lens for the astrograph was purchased.\n\nIn order to save money, it was decided to construct the device independently. The conditions for establishing a stationary astronomical observatory only became suitable in 1928. A year later, an astronomical observatory with a geodetic station started operating in the suburb of Aleksotas, in the First Battery of the former Kaunas Fortress I, with the joint efforts of the university and the Topography Department of the Lithuanian Army Headquarters. The work was financed by the army, this was why the institution was named \"Astronomical Observatory of the Ministry of National Defence\". April 29, 1929 is the official founding date of the Kaunas Observatory.\n\nAfter purchasing a good quality passage and universal instruments made by the \"Ascona\" company in Bamberg, as well as two Riefler clocks, the facility was well prepared for geodesy work. Underground casemates were ideal for storing precision clocks. At the same time, a small pavilion with a rotating dome for the astrograph was constructed on the embankment of the battery, and Kodatis began to study sunspots and stars. The sunspot study was coordinated with Zurich.\n\nKaunas I fort was occupied by the Russian army in 1940. All scientific work was stopped, and neither the equipment nor the collected data were allowed to be taken. When the war broke out, the retreating Russian troops blew up the fort, destroying the astrograph and the data. Kodaitis managed to save only the 63 cm reflector telescope’s mirror which was received from the USA in 1938. To this day it is successfully used in the Molėtai observatory. Passage and universal instruments also remained; after the war, they went to the Department of Geodesy, and now they are kept at Vilnius Gediminas technical university (VILNIUS TECH).",
  "text_saulesLaikrodziai": "The movement of the shadow makes it possible to observe the flow of time. This was understood even by the ancient Egyptians or the Chinese, who widely used such measuring devices as early as the middle of the 2nd millennium BC. Through Babylon, sundials spread throughout the ancient world. In the Middle Ages, the construction of sundials became based on the knowledge of positional astronomy and was called gnomonics (a gnomon is a rod or a plate, in monumental sundials - an obelisk, whose shadow on the dial shows the time.)\n\nIt is interesting that in our time, sundials have not lost their status as scientific instruments - they are used to guide devices operating in space, and new sundials are still being installed in Lithuanian cities. For example, in 2006, one was installed at the University of Technology in Kaunas and in 2021, Švenčionėliai commemorated its history with a sundial table. It is worth mentioning the sundial in the Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania: the author of this work, Arvydas Každailis, decorated it with a Latin inscription meaning \"May the sun always shine in the heart of Lithuania\". Of course, the astronomers at Molėtai Observatory have also decorated their building with a sundial.\n\nIndeed, the history of sundials in Lithuania has deep roots! In the 16th and 17th centuries, it was common for a prominent building in our region to have a sundial. The most famous professors taught the science of gnomonics at Vilnius University and colleges. The walls of the Vilnius university palace are decorated with them: restorers found a fragment of the morning clock in the Great Courtyard, and in 2022, three southern clocks with markings of canonical hours were found on the facade of the Faculty of History.\n\nLithuanian sundials have distinctive features: engravings with dedication inscriptions, owners' coats of arms, wishes for success and glory, as well as additional marks for the hours according to ancient methods of time calculation. Some of them also contain a lot of astronomical information.\n\nIn our region, there are two park sundials extremely valuable from an artistic perspective. One of them is near Kėdainiai town hall. This sundial is of a rare construction - the gnomon here is represented by a rather massive top of a Greek cross, and the hour markers are on its sides. The clock in Švėkšna Park is a replica of an ancient Roman altar of astrological prophecies kept in the Louvre. The dial is surrounded by twelve heads of Roman gods. One of the oldest sundials in our region is located in Šiauliai on the southern walls of the Basilica of the Apostles Peter and Paul; the established opinion is that it was installed here around 1625. The Pažaislis Monastery church towers are decorated with huge dials - this mechanical clock was made in the middle of the 17th century, one of the oldest in Lithuania.\n\nHowever, the best location for a sundial in Lithuania is on the Parnidis dune near Nida. Only from here, can you see how the sun comes out of the water and sinks into the water - from the lagoon to the sea. The top of the dune is now protected from the wind by a monumental sundial - a calendar whose obelisk is almost 14 meters tall (authors of the work are Ričardas Krištopavičius, Klaudijus Pūdymas, Libertas Klimka). It is the largest structure of this kind in the Baltic States!",
  "text_struve": "This is a chain of triangulation (triangles) nearly 3.000 km long, designed to determine the exact length of the Earth's meridian arc and calculate the shape and size of the Earth. The shape of our planet is not regular: it is deformed by rotation, uneven distribution of the continents’ mass, and the pull of the Moon. Struvė geodesic arc extends from Norway to Moldova: from the Arctic to the Black Sea.\n\nToday, the geodetic arc passes through 10 countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, and Moldova. To calculate the meridian arc, fragments of the triangulation networks measured in the Russian Empire were used. When connected, the fragments make up a circuit consisting of 12 sections, inserted between astronomical points, having 10 measured bases and connecting 259 triangulation points. The points are the tops of designated triangles. For the purpose of installing measurement devices, wooden pyramids, known as signals, were built in hilly areas, where their height ranged from 5 to 11 meters. In forested areas, they were as high as 20-40 meters. The average length of the sides of the triangles was 27 km.\n\nThe oldest part of the Struvė geodetic arc was measured in 1816-1821 in the Vilnius Governorate under the leadership of Karl Tenner. Among other devices, the equipment from the observatory of Vilnius University was used for the project. The work on the territory of Estonia and Latvia was organized by Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struvė, director of the astronomical observatory of the University of Dorpat (Tartu), after whom the arc is named. Struvė and Tenner's triangulation networks were connected in 1829.\n\nIn 1855-1888, the measurement data were compiled, and the length of the Earth's meridian was calculated based on them. In the 19th century, this was the most precisely measured and the longest arc of the meridian, whose measurement results were used in cartographic works for an entire century, until the advent of space geodesy methods. Undoubtedly, the work should be regarded as a great scientific feat, as it required the highest qualifications and enormous efforts from the executors. The accuracy of the measurements still surprises experts today.\n\nMeasuring the meridian arc has great scientific, historical, and cultural value, this project is an excellent example of international cooperation between scientists and countries’ leaders for scientific progress. Therefore, some surviving geodetic points in 2005 were designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\nThere are 3 UNESCO points in Lithuania - Meškonys, Paliepiukai (Vilnius district), and Gireišiai (Rokiškis district).",
  "text_tekstilesInstitutas": "A large-scale textile industry started immediately after the First World War in several cities in Lithuania. Historically, the concentration of fabric weaving factories in Kaunas was probably the highest in the country. These are woolen fabric companies \"Drobė\" (founded in 1922), \"Liteksas\" (founded in 1927), and others. After the Second World War, Kaunas acquired the reputation of a textile city.\n\nA quarter of a century later, an artificial fiber was created - acetates, which were extracted from wood cellulose. In Kaunas, since 1966, the acetate thread company - \"Kaunas artificial fiber factory\" has been operating. Eventually, the company became the largest one of its kind in Europe. Back in 2002, its products accounted for about 30% of the European market for such fabric! Together with the establishment of this company in 1961, the Lithuanian Textile Industry Research Institute was founded. The first scientific works of the institute were aimed at researching and improving artificial thread production technologies, creating an assortment of materials from these threads, etc. Since 1980, the institute has started working in a new field of technical textile science. Textiles in aviation and space are known to be used for parts of aircraft, astronaut clothing of unique properties, and elsewhere. Scientists of the Institute started working on such materials for the space industry of the USSR: materials for covering the hull of the \"Buran\" spaceship, cosmonauts' clothing worn in extreme conditions, and others.\n\nDue to the fierce competition with the US space achievements, the Moscow Aviation Institute gave the task to eight institutes - to find a way to stitch a 3 cm thick non-woven material. The institute in Kaunas also received such a task, which was carried out by sewing technologist Vida Baltrušaitienė, who headed the laboratory. In the USSR, it was impossible to weld material of such thickness mechanically at that time. However, a solution was found, and the spacecraft \"Buran\" took off into space. Vida Baltrušaitienė should definitely be included in the ranks of the pioneers of spacecraft protective equipment development. Unfortunately, so far there are no comparisons of how the materials created by the Lithuanian scientist could be superior to the protective materials of the US spaceships.\n\nSince 2012, the Lithuanian Textile Institute has been affiliated with the Center for Physical and Technological Sciences. Armored vests currently being developed in the Department of Textile Technology have been tested in test centers in the USA and Germany, they meet the requirements of the globally recognized NIJ (National Institute of Justice) standard. The institute is also working on the development of medically applicable tissues, for example, in the fields of surgical textiles or human tissue substitutes.",
  "text_teorinesFizikosInstitutas": "In 1990, the Institute of Theoretical Physics and Astronomy was founded on the basis of several departments of the Physics Institute. In the same year, the Lithuanian Museum of Ethnocosmology was established. In 1991 at the Molėtai observatory, work started using the new 165 cm reflector telescope which was the largest such telescope in Lithuania and all of Northern Europe. In the same year, the Vilnius planetarium was affiliated with the institute. In 2002, the institute acquired the status of an institute of Vilnius University. In 1992, the international scientific journal \"Baltic Astronomy\" began circulating in English. In 1993, a general catalogue of 77.500 stars observed in the Vilnius photometric system was published.\n\nThe Vilnius photometric system is a significant achievement. The system was created in 1965 by astronomers Vytautas Straižys and Kazimieras Zdanavičius. They are the authors of the medium-band seven-colour photometric system known in the world until now. No wonder the scientists of the astrophysics sector, who created the Vilnius photometric system are considered the pioneers in the measurement and classification of faint stars. This is evidenced by the information provided in important scientific journals, websites, and studies. The system of Lithuanian scientists is placed and cited in the technical archives of NASA, published in the form of monographs, and translated into several languages. The system is adapted to the Vatican Observatory telescope on Mount Graham in Arizona, USA. Abroad, the Vilnius photometric system is regarded as one of the most famous inventions made in Lithuania.\n\nIn 1995, with astronomers from the USA and Denmark, a joint photometric system was proposed for the European Space Agency's \"Gaia\" orbital observatory which was launched in 2013.",
  "text_valiulioAkmuo": "In the Neolithic era, our distant ancestors already knew how to polish the stone perfectly, to make tools for both work and combat. Large or uniquely shaped stones acquired an even more important purpose: they became elements of temples, called alkas, functioning as altars. Some of the stones were carved with many tiny holes, their arrangement sometimes resembling constellations. There are several big stones in Lithuania called Mokas. Even medical treatment was done close to the stones. For example, it was believed that dew that gathered in the hollows of stones had magical powers. And large stones engraved with inscriptions and various signs were used to designate the boundaries of the land holdings. An exceptionally interesting Valiulis stone is not too far from the Museum of Ethnocosmology of Lithuania. The dimensions of the reddish-brown medium-grained stone are as follows: length - 3.40 m, width - 3.11 m, height - 2.07 m.\n\nAt the top of the stone, several small cracks are visible, in one of them, rainwater collects. Various icons are carved on the sides of the stone: a cross, a horseshoe, an arrow, a sun, and a semicircle or a moon. The markings on both sides are distinctly different from each other: the horseshoe groove is distinct, wide, and smooth, and the sunspots are deeper and narrower. The first oval is undoubtedly a heraldic personal sign marking the borders of the land. The signs of the second oval may be associated with the mythological images of the Balts - such a cross is known as the goddess of Gabija (goddess of the \"ashes\"); the sun has eight rays, marking the four directions of the world and the four azimuths of the planet’s course during the solstices and equinoxes; the semicircle represents the boat of the sun, in which she sails nightly through the underworld lagoons to the east. The whole scene is like a model of the world - \"what is under the sun\" - the journey of the sun through the cycle of the year and its \"imprisonment\" in the form of fire in the hearth of the house. The oval - means the egg for the beginning of the world. This sign has been chosen as a symbolic ancient cosmogram by the Molėtai Astronomical Observatory.\n\nA bit higher than the stone of Valiulis there is another large rock stuck in the ground and crumbled, known as the father of Valiulis. In fact, there are more large stones around, forming a sort of quadrilateral structure with one semi-circular edge. It seems that this area used to be considered a holy place. It is said about the stone of Valiulis that the devil wanted to block the door of the Skudutiškis church and break the altar with it. Sitting on a stone, the devil enticed the village girls to put on the shoes he sewed. These tales inspired the archaeologist Petras Tarasenka, who was born nearby, to write several famous books for young people, instilling a love for the native land and its history.",
  "text_vepriai": "Cosmic catastrophes are the everyday life of the universe. Cosmic bodies under the influence of gravitational attraction find each other even in the vast spaces of the Universe. Several hundred meteoroids of various sizes enter the Earth's atmosphere every day; it amounts to over 100 thousand tons per year. Most of them burn up in the atmosphere, leaving only a fiery trail. The old men of the village would say - \"the star has fallen, the star has risen to the sky\". Only a rare larger meteoroid reaches the Earth's surface. The largest one was found in Africa, Namibia, it's known as the Hoba meteorite and it weighs as much as 60 tons.\n\nOn the surface of our planet, there are also meteorite craters, made in the distant geological past by collisions with much larger cosmic bodies. These wounds on the face of the Earth, affected by erosion and covered by subsequent sediments, are called astroblemes. The largest of them is the Vrederforth crater in South Africa, which is approximately 300 km in diameter. The appearance of such formations is undoubtedly related to the drastic changes in the Earth's climate, which led to a change in both vegetation and animal species.\n\nLarge space bodies of another kind also crashed into the territory of Lithuania, more than once. The traces of these catastrophes were covered by the moving glaciers, which were filled with moraine gravel, deposits of ice melting. However, astroblemes are preserved in the Earth's crystalline base, at a depth of several hundred meters. In Lithuania, they are of impressive size: the 6.3 km diameter Mizarai astrobleme in the Lazdijai district, near Druskininkai, which appeared 500 million years ago, and the 7-8 km diameter Vepriai astrobleme in the Ukmergė district, which was made approximately 160 million years ago. It is estimated that such five-hundred-meter-deep craters were knocked out by a rocky meteoroid with a diameter of about 200-300 m. Astroblemes are detected by physical methods, by accurately measuring the acceleration of free fall - in those areas, the Earth's gravity is somewhat lower. Then the geologists get to work; their deep boreholes reveal traces of the impact on the rocks - a broken crystalline structure called breccia and glass droplets - tektites - melted from high temperature.",
  "text_vuObservatorija": "The observatory of Vilnius University is a real hub of science, the beginning of which goes back to 1753 when Tomas Žebrauskas founded the observatory. The observatory was soon improved by its new director, Martynas Počobutas, who asked the famous architect Martynas Knakfusas to build the extension of the facility that we can still see today. The classicist elements show important historical events. For example, the Scutum constellation was attributed to the king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Jonas Sobieckis by Danzig astronomer Johannes Hevelius, who in this way expressed his gratitude to king Jonas Sobieckis for his victorious battle against the Turks in 1683 near Vienna. At that time, the Pope of Rome himself begged Jonas Sobieckis to defend the western world from the invasion of the so-called Mohammedans at that time.\n\nThe observatory of Vilnius University has been a well-known and prestigious center of science since its inception, receiving all the latest inventions and precision techniques of the western world. It is interesting that even the famous Galileo Galilei contacted the ruler Vladislovas Vaza, who of all the Vaza dynasty was the one who resided in Vilnius the most. Galileo Galilei sent his telescope lenses to Vilnius, inquiring about the possibility of publishing his scientific works in Lithuania! The observatory still has its first telescope with duke Mykolas Radvila's records. You can also see the surviving old globes of the world and sky, which date back to before the establishment of the observatory and are extremely rare scientific exhibits dating back more than 400 years. We can be proud that the dynamic processes of sunspots were systematically studied in Vilnius for the first time in the history of the world. Photos of sunspots were sent even to South Africa or England, the cradle of science at the time.\n\nThe observatory prepared not only scientific works, and improved research techniques, but also developed calculations necessary for the compilation of calendars, the calculation of church holidays, the construction of sundials, the determination of geographic coordinates, and the drawing of maps.\n\nHowever, the progress of science was hindered and destroyed when the territory was occupied by Moscow, this was also referred to as \"divisions\". Just think about it - the famous astronomer of the university, Juozapas Chodzka, who was related to the nobility of the Vilnius region, was considered dangerous to the tsarist authorities, and therefore sent to work in Transcaucasia! In exile, Juozapas made complex measurements and drew maps of the Caucasus, which, according to his own sad statement, helped the russians subjugate the peoples who lived there.\n\nToday we can take a walk around the impressive White Hall of the observatory, where various instruments, scientific objects, and various pieces of measuring equipment are displayed. It is a truly amazing place that testifies to the scientific potential of our country and the old cultural roots that lead to modern space research and the development of world-famous space equipment. More information about this awaits you at other points on the route.",
  "text_zemaitkiemis": "In 1933, on February 2, at around 9.30 pm the sky of Aukštaitija (the region in Lithuania) was illuminated by an impressive atmospheric phenomenon, accompanied by strong crashing sounds: it was the explosion of a falling meteoroid. Its fragments were found in an elliptical area, approximately 7.5 x 3 km, between two villages near the town of Ukmergė. Some pieces were found on the ground covered with fresh snow very close to homesteads. On February 8th professors Mykolas Kaveckis and Kazys Sleževičius of Vytautas Magnus University arrived in Žemaitkiemis. With the help of the chief of the police station and elementary school teachers and students, they managed to collect 20 pieces of the meteorite. Two more pieces were found later, therefore, the mass of the entire meteorite is ~44 kilograms.\n\nProfessor Kaveckis described the findings in detail and carried out their chemical analysis. The Žemaitkiemis meteorite is stone and its age turns out to be 520 million years!\n\nPieces of this meteorite are exhibited in the State Scientific Research Institute Nature Research Centre, the Geological Museum of Vilnius University, and the Ukmergė Regional Museum. Exchanged for other meteorite samples, also stored in the Natural History Museum in London, the Russian Vernadsky Institute, and the Czech National Museum in Prague. It is believed that pieces of the meteorite can also be found at the bottom of Lake Kliepšiai, so in recent years, international expeditions have been organized to search for them, using modern equipment.",
  "read_more_main_text": "Space has always been a subject that has attracted both ordinary people and scientists seeking a deeper understanding of the vastness of the cosmos. The year 2021 was a special year for Lithuania as we finally became an Associate Member of the European Space Agency. This is the right time to give the space theme an extra focus: to link and highlight Lithuania's achievements in space technology, to showcase related research centres and to showcase the contributions of scientists of Lithuanian origin, which are mostly unknown to the general public. The second piece of the space puzzle is the Molėtai Museum of Ethnocosmology, the only one of its kind in the world, which is located not far from Vilnius. The essence of the museum is the relationship between man and mankind and the cosmic world. The third element of this mobile application is the archaeological, historical, and natural sites all over Lithuania, which are related to cosmology, the cosmos and its observation.\n\nThe aim of the app is to combine all these different and closely related topics into one modern tourism and educational tool, which will allow the user to get to know the topic from its various sides.\n\nThe app contains information on 20 different thematic destinations, but the full content can only be accessed by going to the location of the site, finding the site marker and scanning it. Once you've checked it out, you'll be able to see and hear interesting additional information in 2D, 3D, 360, video, audio, and photo formats.
